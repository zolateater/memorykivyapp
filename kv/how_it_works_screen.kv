This guy suggested a technique to remember large numbers. \nFirst, you need to prepare a list of characters for each combination of 2 digits. \nThen you need to learn your own list. \n\nAfter that when you need to remember some number you can just split it by 2 digits and memoize your characters. \nSo this app allows you to simplify maintaining of such list and to do some practice."""
